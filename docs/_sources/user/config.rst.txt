Config Usage
============

NeST uses config to let the user define a few properties of NeST. For
example, whether or not all the namespaces are to be deleted after the
completion of the program is decided by the value of that parameter.
All parameters have a default value set by NeST.
However, the default values can be overridden using API's of
:ref:`Config` module. They can also be overridden using files named as
`nest-config.json` in specified locations such as
"`/etc/nest-config.json`", "`~/.nest-config.json`" and in the current
working directory as "`nest-config.json`" with increasing priority (if
the same parameter has different values in different files, the one with
the higher priority is chosen)

Now, let's take a look at all the parametes that can be configured

.. note::

   | **<Parameter> (Default_value)** - Description
   | Possible values

| **plot_results (true)** - When set to True, the results are plotted
| ``true, false``

| **readme_in_stats_folder (true)** - When set to True, a readme file is added in the results folder, with information about how the results are stored
| ``true, false``

| **routing_suite ("quagga")** - A string, which tells which suite is to be used for dynamic routing
| ``"quagga", "frr"``

| **routing_logs (false)** - When set to true, routing logs are written to files in a dedicated logs folder
| ``true, false``

| **assign_random_names (true)** - When set to True, uses random names (i.e., uniquely generated ids) generated by NeST for all the namespaces and devices
| ``true, false``

| **default_bandwidth ("1024mbit")** - The default bandwidth to be set to every connection
| ``"<number><unit>"``
| number - any positive number
| unit - kbit, mbit, gbit

| **delete_namespaces_on_termination (true)** - When set to true, deletes all namespaces that were created by NeST, on termination
| ``true, false``

| **disable_dad (true)** - When set to true, Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) in ipv6 is disabled
